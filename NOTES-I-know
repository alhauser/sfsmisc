As already for  sfsmisc 1.0-25 and 1.0-26:
When checking (with --as-cran)  I get 2  NOTE s  which I don't think are
easy to workaround :

NOTES:
------
1)
  * checking R code for possible problems ... NOTE
  tkdensity : replot: no visible binding for '<<-' assignment to ‘._nbw’
  tkdensity : replot: no visible binding for '<<-' assignment to ‘._xZ’
  tkdensity : replot: no visible binding for '<<-' assignment to ‘._xM’

2)
  Found the following calls to attach():
  File ‘sfsmisc/R/sourceAttach.R’:
    attach(ENV, pos = pos, name = name, warn.conflicts = warn.conflicts)
  See section ‘Good practice’ in ‘?attach’.

EXPLANATIONS:
------------

1) I've already used globalVariables() there, and the '<<-' is
   relevant and related to the special tcltk semantics in use there.

2) sourceAttach() is a utility which uses source() and does not
  do that into the globalenv but rather into a new position in the
  search() path, something which can well desirable compared
  to the default source()ing into globalenv.
