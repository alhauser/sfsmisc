3) Feb.2004 : Close before CRAN release

   - Improve ps.end(): should return something useful
     ==> new ./tests/psend-ex.R which tests that 2 x {ps.do() ... ps.end()}
     *does* work properly

   - Make use of R/p.res.2x.formula.R --> generic function with
     default and formula method where the latter calls the former.


5) mat2tex() is really not flexible enough; and there are better functions
   in other packages, e.g. latex in 'Hmisc' --> deprecate this! [2005-04]

o) add Duplicated() {see ./Duplicated-fun.R } !!

6) 2008-10-22: Copied  boxplot.matrix() to R-devel (2.9.0 to be)
   Remove this from 'sfsmisc' eventually.

7) eaxis() [ ./R/prettylab.R ] :
   -  allow  log2-scale and "2^..." labelling --- or log_k and 'k^..'
   -  this is a range where the *defaults* of eaxis are completely bad
      --> but really it is because  axTicks(*, log=TRUE) can be bad:
    curve(qgamma(1e-100, x, lower.tail=FALSE), 1e-110, 1e-70, log="xy", col=2, axes=FALSE)
    eaxis(1);eaxis(2)
